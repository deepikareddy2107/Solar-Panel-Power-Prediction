# Solar-Panel-Power-Prediction
To analyze the relationship between environmental variables and solar power generation, and to develop a predictive model for forecasting energy production.
This project, titled Solar Power Generation Analysis, focuses on predicting the energy produced by solar panels based on various environmental factors using regression techniques. The dataset contains 2920 instances recorded over 3-hour intervals, with 10 features such as temperature, wind speed, visibility, humidity, and distance to solar noon. The primary goal is to explore the relationship between these environmental variables and the power generated by the solar panels, measured in joules. The project involved data preprocessing, including handling a missing value in the "average wind speed" variable, and conducting extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and correlations in the dataset. Multiple regression models were developed and evaluated using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² to identify the most effective approach for predicting solar power generation. Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were utilized to perform data manipulation, modeling, and visualization. The outcome of this project provides valuable insights into the factors affecting solar energy production and can be used to optimize future power generation strategies.
